      <%# <p>Forbes Allen Gardens took on the maintenance of this three-acre garden in late 2019. The garden has a range of magnificent mature trees, unusual shrubs. A central lawn sweeps down to a woodland area with a winding stream. Secretive paths run on the boundary and through a woodland walk.The gar- den had been originally planted in an architectural style but over time had become overgrown, hiding a ‘Lovers Walk’ with some trees and shrubs poorly pruned and overgrown.</p>
      <p>Since 2019 the team have worked with the clients to reinstate a recently discovered pathway and planting areas, planting new varieties of trees and establishing a composting and leaf mould regime. All projects have reflected the clients’ passion for using non-biological controls and enhancing biodiversity. During lockdown, to make use of the existing greenhouse, raised vegetable beds and some borders have been converted into vegetable growing areas.</p>

      <p>Our approach is built on expert plant knowledge and an understanding of what will work in any given space, large or small, exterior or interior. We have extensive contacts within the horticultural industry and can source and supply plants and other materials from a range of specialist nurseries across the UK.</p>
      <p>We can call on a range of specialist contractors, from hard landscaping to irrigation, to assist with any project. We also enjoy working with other designers when we feel their skills and experience can bring additional benefits to an assignment.</p>
      <p>Our design work tends to be informed by a naturalistic approach but we are equally happy to use more formal structures depending on the space and individual preferences.  Wherever possible, we favour using organic methods and materials, and likewise we aim to focus on sustainability.</p>
