      <h3> The Lodge </h3>
    </div>
    <div class="show-text">
      <p>Forbes Allen Gardens took on the maintenance of this three-acre garden in late 2019. The garden has a range of magnificent mature trees, unusual shrubs. A central lawn sweeps down to a woodland area with a winding stream. Secretive paths run on the boundary and through a woodland walk.The gar- den had been originally planted in an architectural style but over time had become overgrown, hiding a ‘Lovers Walk’ with some trees and shrubs poorly pruned and overgrown.</p>
      <p>Since 2019 the team have worked with the clients to reinstate a recently discovered pathway and planting areas, planting new varieties of trees and establishing a composting and leaf mould regime. All projects have reflected the clients’ passion for using non-biological controls and enhancing biodiversity. During lockdown, to make use of the existing greenhouse, raised vegetable beds and some borders have been converted into vegetable growing areas.</p>
