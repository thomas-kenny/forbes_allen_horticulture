      <p>Forbes Allen designed this front garden in 2020. The client wanted to make the garden useful by installing a new smart bike shed but also providing seasonal planting interest when looking out of a basement kitchen and complementing the fa√ßade of the elegant terraced Georgian house. Reclaimed York Stone stepping stones were incorporated to access services and make the maintenance of the garden easier. Granite setts were used as a forecourt to access the bike shed. The garden had an established Yew hedge and Acer so new plants were chosen to complement these, and provide year-round interest. A range of bulbs are planted annually to extend the season.</p>
