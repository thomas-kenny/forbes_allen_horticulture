    <p>Forbes Allen designed this garden in 2016 and have been maintaining it since. The garden benefits from a west facing aspect and is enclosed on all three sides by the sweetly scented climber Trachelospermum jasminoides. Indian sandstone on the ground and rendered wall planters provide differ- ing heights to the scheme. Architectural plants provide all year-round interest, interspersed with herbaceous plants. A variety of large containers in- clude specimen shrubs and plants. A recently installed irrigation system assists with preserving the plants and precious water.</p>
